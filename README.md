# Project Title

PlayAnalytics, an AI-Driven Sports Management Portal:
presented by Juan Carlos Katigbak 300366535 to Padmapriya Arasanipalai Kandhadai CSIS4495 Applied Research Project Section 002

## About the Project

PlayAnalytics is a sports management portal utilizing machine learning to predict injury risks and deliver data-driven insights tailored specifically for basketball athletes. By integrating predictive analytics, PlayAnalytics empowers athletes to proactively minimize injury risks and optimize training effectiveness.

### Folders Included

ReportsAndDocuments/ - Contains all reports and documentation related to the project.
Implementation/ - Stores all code implementations, including backend, frontend, and machine learning models.
Misc/ - References such as Books, Research Journals and Studies, and Websites.


### Installing (using either macOS/Linux's Terminal or Windows' Command Prompt)

1. Extraction of playanalytics.zip 

Extract playanalytics.zip and make sure that the extracted folder will have the files because there is a tendency that the extracted folder will have another folder before you are able to get the files. You then need to extract the playanalytics folder and put it somewhere where you can start the app, like on the Desktop.


2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

For macOS/Linux (Terminal):
python -m venv env

For Windows (Command Prompt):
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

For macOS/Linux (Terminal)/For Windows (Command Prompt):
pip install django-bootstrap5 joblib scikit-learn numpy pandas

4. Run the Application

using macOS/Linux's Terminal, run:

cd playanalytics (depending on the location of the folder, suggestion would be cd ~/Desktop then cd playanalytics)

python manage.py runserver

using Windows' Command Prompt, run:

cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\playanalytics
(e.g. cd OneDrive\Desktop\playanalytics)

python manage.py runserver

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or localhost:8000 - which is usually the default)

## When Using the App

When you first land on the landing page, click Start and you will go to the Dashboard page which still has no data because the app requires that you populate it with player data to see how everything works in relation to predicting injury risk. So click on the Prediction tab in the navigation bar and you will go to the Prediction page which is where you will predict your injury risk by inputting your performance stats and injury history. Once you click Predict, you will be shown 2 bar charts, with the first one being your prediction and the second one having no prediction yet because the app is all about populating it with player data such as yours and other players. Then you have a choice whether to save this to the Profile page or to make a new Prediction. If you click Save to Profile, you will be transported to the Profile page where you can add a profile picture of yourself/players, edit data that was inputted, create notes about performance routines, injuries sustained, ongoing recovery, et cetera. If you click on the Dashboard tab in the navigation, you will see performance indicators and data visualizations in real time. Keep populating the app with data to see how the data visualizations will look like!
