# Project Title

Sports Management Portal for Injury Prevention, Performance, and Athlete Management Using Machine Learning:
presented by Juan Carlos Katigbak 300366535 to Padmapriya Arasanipalai Kandhadai CSIS4495 Applied Research Project Section 002

## About the Project

Design
Develop a web-based portal incorporating ML models for injury prediction, performance analytics, and training customization.

Objectives
a.Create a database to store athlete profiles and performance metrics. 
b.Train an ML model to predict injury risks using historical data.
c.Build interactive dashboards for visualizing performance trends.

### Folders Included

ReportsAndDocuments - for all the reports and documentation
Implementation - for all the code that will be checked in


### Installing

Notes: A step by step series of examples that tell me how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Notes: Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Notes: Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Notes: Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Notes: Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
