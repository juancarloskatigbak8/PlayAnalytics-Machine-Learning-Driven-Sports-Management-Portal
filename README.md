# Project Title

Sports Management Portal for Injury Prevention, Performance, and Athlete Management Using Machine Learning:
presented by Juan Carlos Katigbak 300366535 to Padmapriya Arasanipalai Kandhadai CSIS4495 Applied Research Project Section 002

## About the Project

Design
Develop a web-based portal incorporating ML models for injury prediction, performance analytics, and training customization.

Objectives
a.Create a database to store athlete profiles and performance metrics. 
b.Train an ML model to predict injury risks using historical data.
c.Build interactive dashboards for visualizing performance trends.

### Folders Included

ReportsAndDocuments/ - Contains all reports and documentation related to the project.
Implementation/ - Stores all code implementations, including backend, frontend, and machine learning models.
Misc/ - References such as Books, Research Journals and Studies, and Websites.


### Installing

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/juancarloskatigbak8/sports-management-portal.git
cd sports-management-portal

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up the Database

python manage.py migrate

5. Run the Application

python manage.py runserver

6. Access the Portal

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Running the tests
